# APIRateLimiter
Given a maximum count (maxRequests) of allowable requests in time period (timeLimit) seconds, write a function with input as Customer ID (userID) to validate whether a request can "Proceed" or not ("Max Limit Reached") for that particular user.
* <ins>Application in real world coding scenario</ins>: We can use this for any APIs for validating whether the request count to that API by a given user has exceeded a certain limit.
